Italian guy who just finished a Master in Computer Science (max grade of the italian academic grading cum laude, woohoo!). My main interests are devops, game and web dev. But let's say software in general.

I love learning new programming languages and new paradigms. I try out frameworks and libraries all the time and always have one or two CS books in my to-read list. So I decided to start writing about it instead of learning and keeping it for myself.

This blog was made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the awesome theme [Origin](https://gitlab.com/asleeppiano/origin-hugo-theme) by Andrey Parfenov (when I saw it I dropped my Nextjs + TailwindCSS blog I was making and switched to this).
